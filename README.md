```

### GET /metrics
Protected metrics endpoint for monitoring systems (only accessible from localhost or private networks).

## Performance Optimizations

### Connection Pooling
The API uses connection pooling for HTTP requests to improve network performance and reduce connection overhead.

### Parallel Processing
- Thread pool for concurrent operations
- Parallel prefetching of images from multiple subreddits
- Asynchronous health checks

### Caching
The API implements multiple levels of caching:
1. In-memory caching for prefetched images
2. Redis-based response caching (when configured) for API responses
3. Optimized cache key generation for faster lookups

### Response Compression
Responses are automatically compressed using gzip when they exceed a configurable threshold and the client supports compression.

### Adaptive Prefetching
The API implements a smart, adaptive prefetching system:

1. **Smart Subreddit Selection**
   - Prioritizes subreddits with low image counts
   - Favors popular subreddits based on request frequency
   - Includes random subreddits for exploration
   - Temporarily avoids subreddits with repeated errors

2. **Dynamic Scheduling**
   - Adjusts prefetch intervals based on demand and performance
   - Triggers immediate prefetching when popular subreddits run low on images
   - Implements exponential backoff for error recovery

3. **Efficient Image Management**
   - Maintains minimum thresholds of images per subreddit
   - Avoids duplicate images in the prefetch cache
   - Tracks image usage patterns to optimize prefetching

4. **Error Resilience**
   - Tracks error rates by subreddit
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Automatically recovers from temporary API failures

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Detailed metrics on prefetch operations
   - Subreddit popularity tracking
   - Error rate monitoring by subreddit

### Request Timeout Management
All external API calls have configurable timeouts to prevent slow operations from blocking the API.

## Content Filtering

The API implements a simple text-based content filtering system to ensure that only appropriate cat images are served:

1. Pattern-based filtering that checks for potentially unsafe words or phrases
2. Filtering applied to post titles to screen out inappropriate content
3. Configurable patterns that can be easily updated or extended

## Security Features

### Input Validation
All API endpoints validate input parameters to prevent injection attacks and ensure proper data formatting.

### Rate Limiting
- 100 requests per day per IP address
- 30 requests per hour per IP address
- 10 requests per minute per IP address

### Security Headers
The API implements the following security headers:
- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy

### CORS Support
The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with configurable origins.

#### CORS Configuration
- By default, requests from any origin are allowed
- For production, configure the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to restrict access
- Preflight requests are automatically handled

**Note for Production**: Always restrict CORS origins in a production environment for enhanced security.
